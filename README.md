# Customer Purchase History Project

## Overview
This project analyzes a customer purchase dataset using SQL Server.

## Dataset
- 1,800 rows of customer purchase history
- Columns include CustomerID, Product, Quantity, UnitPrice, TotalPrice, PaymentMethod, ReviewRating, etc.

## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL Server: database creation, table design, data ingestion
- Data Quality: NULL checks, business logic validation
- Feature Engineering: PurchaseYear, PurchaseMonth
- Business Analysis: total revenue, revenue by category, top products/customers, AOV
- Advanced SQL: CTEs, views for reuse and Power BI integration

## Files
- `Data/` — CSV of cleaned dataset
- `SQL/` — All SQL scripts organised by purpose
