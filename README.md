# Customer-Purchase-History-End-to-End-SQL-Power-BI-Analysis
I built an end-to-end data analytics project using SQL for data cleaning &amp; analysis and Power BI for visualisation, starting from raw Excel data.

***Cleaning and preparing
• I performed comprehensive data quality checks including NULL validation, business rule validation, and calculated field verification using SQL.
• Performed revenue, customer, product, and time-series analysis using SQL Server
• Built business KPIs including total revenue, AOV, and top customer analysis
• I created reusable SQL views and used CTEs to structure analytical logic and prepare optimised datasets for BI tools.
